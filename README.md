# server-management-api
Simple API with Spring Boot for a server management and pinging service

IMPORTANT:
-Make sure to change the password, url and user(if you aren't using root) on application.yml so it works for you as well. Of course also make sure to create a SQL database as well (table creation is handled automatically by the API)
-For the frontend that goes with this app check out this repository: https://github.com/ErtiRakipaj/server-management-app
